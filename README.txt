talk-semantic-versioning.txt contains a lightning talk about Semantic
Versioning, a method of numbering releases that conveys specific
information about their stability and backwards compatibility.

That file in an ad hoc Markdown-like format, but it's not strictly
Markdown. Just view it in a text editor with a fixed width font, like a normal
person. ;)

I hope it's helpful! If you have questions, please file a bug report
or email me.

Thanks,
Quinn
